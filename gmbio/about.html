                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I grew up in Kansas with three siblings and a dog, where I learned to love tabletop games as well as games of all varieties, books, stories, and adventure.
                    I live now in Pennsylvania, with a wife who will play sometimes, and two cats who never have.
                    I work as a software quality analyst and program in my spare time.</p>
                <h2>Tabletop Experience</h2>
                <p>I've been playing D&D since my 9th Christmas thanks to a gifted Dungeons and Dragons Basic Game box set that my siblings and I fell in love with.
                    Since then I've branched out, with Pathfinder 2e being my current main system of play. I've run games both local and remote, with my current longform campaign
                taking place on the Foundry VTT. I also act as a player and sometimes as GM at my local gaming store in the area.</p>
                <h2>Preferred Systems</h2>
                <ul><li>Pathfinder 2e</li> 
                    <li>Starfinder</li>
                    <li>Pathfinder 1e</li>
                    <li>Dungeons and Dragons 5e</li>
