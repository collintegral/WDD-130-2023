I propose creation of a site that will serve as a landing page/information hub for Pathfinder and D&D TTRPG games that I run. It fulfils the requirements as follows:

1. The personal site will consist of a home page, containing links to and a brief summary of any campaigns I am running, as well as a page describing myself as game leader.
For purposes of the assignment, it will include a sample campaign that would serve as a template for all future entries.

2. The site will be hosted on the web.

3.1. The home page will describe the purpose of the page and list its children; the campaign template will include sample sections to describe the following:
 - Campaign setting
 - Campaign schedule
 - Current players
 - A brief summary of events to date
Meanwhile, the About Me page will include the following:
 - My experience and history
 - Games I run or would consider running
 - My location and software I use to run games
 
3.2. The home page will contain general imagery for those familiar with tabletop games: dice, pencils, grid paper, and so on.
The sample campaign page will include a map of the setting, and images of characters as they are provided by the players.
The About Me page will include a picture of myself, and possibly supplemental imagery depending on the final contents.

3.3. The home page will include multiple links to the children.

3.4. The site will be laid out according to the wireframe.

3.5. The site will be relatively visually appealing (hopefully), and easily readable.
