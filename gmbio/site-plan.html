      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        This site will serve as a landing page/information hub for Pathfinder and D&D TTRPG games that I run. Primarily, it will be used as a sort of online "business card site", a link for me to share if someone is asking regarding my GM style, my current campaigns, or my experiences in TTRPGs. Additionally, it can be useful as an organizational tool for myself, giving me a place to keep track of events in campaigns as they occur so I can look back on them later and remember. Though it's beyond the scope of this assignment, I could even include a private admin login that would allow me to add and view notes for events that haven't even happened yet, invisible to anyone else visiting the site.
        Given the primary audience of this site, it's going to be a place for reading more than anything else. Anything I can do to organize thoughts and present information succinctly and attractively will help ease the process of understanding what's being offered. Well-formatted text, sections broken up by art and other delineators, even dropdowns to keep details out of the way until needed, would all help to clean up the presentation of information and provide an easier reading experience for the visitor. There are to be two primary sections of the website. First, the section describing my past and ongoing campaigns, and second, the section describing myself as a GM. The presentation of each will need to be fairly different.
        If I have the time to work on it at the end of the assignment, I would be very interested in the "admin view" mentioned in the synopsis. Though passwords and accounts are likely beyond the scope of this assignment, I could potentially include some form of checkbox selector that would keep "GM notes" hidden until it was selected. However, I'm not sure if something like that is possible without delving into Javascript or another programming language, which, again, would be beyond the scope. Still, it's a fun idea!

      </ul>
      <h3>GM Bio</h3>
      <p>
        For the first page, the bio section, I'll want to include plenty of images, short blurbs, and catchy pitches, in a way that will likely resemble a resume or sales pitch. I'll include a brief section about my personal life, but most of it will be more focused -- how long I've been playing TTRPGs, the systems I'm familiar with or interested in, and the game styles I have more experience with. There's something to be said for both a professional presentation and a more familiar approach, so I'll have to decide which fits better as I get into more details later.

      </ul>
      <h3>Campaigns</h3>
      <p>
        For the second page, the campaign section, information will be presented somewhat more densely. This is where tools like dropdown expansions will be particularly useful, as I can fit a greater number of campaigns in the page without overwhelming the reader, or forcing them to scroll endlessly to reach the bottom-most entry. I imagine each campaign will have a title, a short summary, and a dropdown to expand it and read more. Within that box, there can be a longer summary of the campaign, a chronology of key events that have taken place, and a section describing the characters that have participated, possibly contained within another set of dropdowns.
