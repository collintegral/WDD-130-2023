        <h2>Collin Christensen</h2>
        <p>I am a current SQA professional living with my wife and three cats, seeking a degree to further my career and unlock new options and opportunities for myself and my family. My wife is crafty, enjoying painting, baking, and creating costumes every year for Halloween. I fall more on the creative side, enjoying board and tabletop games, reading, and writing. I lived in Tempe, Arizona for two years, and am currently residing in Pennsylvania.</p>
            <p>I don't have much more to write right now, but I'm looking forward to learning in the class!</p>
